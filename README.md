This project was done as part of an "Advanced Programming" course at Ariel University. <br/>
In this project I implemented some of the functions of the [ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)) editor that is in the Linux system

To implement some of the functions I used a regular expression by a [library in cpp](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex)
